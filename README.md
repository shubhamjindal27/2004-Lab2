# Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic ML model

In this exercise we have taken Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic) and created ML model to predict whether the cancer is Malignant or Benign based on given parameters

We have created classification models using various techniques such as:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- KNN Model
- SVM

We have trained the models and then evaluated and compared the accuracies.
